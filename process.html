          <p>Our box mitigates the effects of long gray winters by allowing users to design their own lighting solutions in which the color temperature and brightness mimic those of sunnier days. It is designed to be safe enough such that amateurs can rig up their own lighting systems without fear of shock. Our idea was to accomplish this by stepping down the voltage to 12v at the outlet and then using LED strips as the light source. </p>
          <p><b>Background:</b> We thought of this idea to provide us with a challenge in multiple fields. On one hand, we had to solve the electronics and on the other, we had to create a smart and safe box design. The box seemed to be an object simple enough so that we could outdo ourselves in making a finished product in the best possible quality and choose the perfect materials. </p>

          <p>Our light mitigates the effects of long gray winters by providing wonderful organic lighting. A key part of our motivation was constituted by the wonderful light play created by the trees in front of a window at GIX. In Japanese, there is a word for this phenomenon: Komorebi.</p>
          <p><b>Background:</b> We pivoted our design based on our instructors' feedback to create an artistic challenge for us to solve, away from a box controlling light sources, towards an actual light that recreates the natural quality of the sun.</p>

          <h2 class="mt0">Material Study # 1 - Acrylic</h2>
          <p>We studied how transparent and milky acrylics bends under the influence of heat and break light in mint, bent, or etched states. We used a heat gun to heat the acrylic, laser cutters for edging, and LED strips as the light source. Bending acrylic with heat is possible and easy on thin and slender pieces of acrylic. Transparent acrylic breaks the light, whereas milky acrylic glows golden but does not break the light. When confining the light source to spread in a certain area (such as in a cardboard box) and obstructing it with transparent acrylic pieces, the light can break nicely. The tests were promising, but we want to test more materials.</p>

          <h2 class="mt0">Material Study  #2 - Resin and Hot Glue</h2>
          <p>We studied how resin and hot glue shapes break light. The shapes were created using a silicone mold. LED strips were used as the light source. The resin does not break the light but emits a steady warm glow. The same applies to hot glue since neither of the shapes turned out to be transparent after hardening. We will not use resin or hot glue shapes in our prototypes because their properties in breaking light are similar to the ones found in milky acrylic.</p>

          <h2 class="mt0">Prototype #1 - Chandelier</h2>
          <p>We took what we've learned from the milky acrylic study and attempted to create a first prototype to recreate the natural quality of "Komorebi". The prototype was constituted of an "eyeball"-lamp with one rotational axis that would allow it to move from one side to the other over a day.  Milky acrylic leaves were used to obstruct the light. We hoped the leaves would create a golden glow.</p>    
          <p><b>Result:</b> We could not create the desired effect because our light source was too close to the obstructing leaves. Also, in reality, the light rays of the sun travel parallelly and hit objects from a certain direction. In our prototype, this was not the case. </p>
          <p><b>Learning:</b> Recreating the sun requires creativity.</p>

          <h2 class="mt0">Prototype #2 - Waterbath</h2>
          <p>We took what we've learned from the transparent acrylic study and created a second prototype using water's light reflection properties. We used an adjustable light beam spotlight LED bulb. It allowed us to choose the perfect focus of light.</p>    
            <p><b>Result:</b> We were able to create a wonderful organic light play in a room if we position the light source at a certain angle and distance and kept the water in motion. However, the positioning of the light source turned out to be a real challenge, since even with the most focused light setting, the light would still dissipate too much before hitting the small water bath.  </p>
            <p><b>Learning:</b> We need to confine the space the light can travel in, such that as much as possible hits the water bath. This goes in line with our findings from material study #1.</p>

          <h2 class="mt0">Prototype #3 - Cardboard Box</h2>
          <p>Combining everything we have learned so far, we decided to box our light source, and instead of directly projecting organic shapes on the walls of a room, we now aimed to create projections on the top side of the box using paper as a screen, aiming that in a dark room, the projections would also be visible on the room's surfaces. The insides of a cardboard box were lined with a Mylar sheet. We planned to install the water basin on the bottom surface of the box to create projects on a paper sheet obstructing the top side of the box. </p>    
            <p><b>Result:</b> We quickly noticed that the imperfections of the Mylar sheet's surface on the box's walls, combined with lightly moving our light source, already created beautiful, organic projections on the paper surface, without even installing the basin.  </p>
            <p><b>Learning:</b> We decided to move away from using water to create organic light projections and focus solely on the reflective properties of the Mylar sheet. </p>

          <h2 class="mt0">Final Prototype - Coffee Table</h2>
          <p>Our final prototype is a rectangular, wooden, and hollow box that can be used as a coffee table. The top surface of the box is comprised of two layers of glass with one layer of trace paper in-between. All walls of the box are coated with Mylar sheets. The light source is installed at a fixed angle in the center of the box and an electric motor in the inside of the box powers two rotational surfaces that are coated in Mylar sheet. The surfaces rotated at around 0.9 rounds per minute. Organic and slowly shifting light projections are created on the paper surface and radiate even further on the surroundings. The materials glass and wood give the product a finished feel. </p>
